Controlling the Baxter robot using Virtual reality device (HTC VIVE)

# How to get the VIVE controller information
triad_openvr is an open source software built on top of the openvr library. It provides a list of basic functions to access controller information, touch pad coordinates, trigger status, etc. Link: https://github.com/TriadSemi/triad_openvr.git.

In my project, I used triad_openvr library to extract VIVE controller information (Code is present in 'Client_VR' directory)
